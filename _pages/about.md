## Brief introduction
I am a undergraduate student majoring bioinformatics and minoring mathematics at CUHK-Shenzhen who are expected to graduate at 2023.

## My plan
With a strong interest in the nature of physics and chemistry, I am seeking a postgraduate degree about computational chemistry/biology currently.

## Skills
Although I hardly took any CS-related courses during undergraduate study, benefit from a strong I am able to perform basic programming using `Python`, `Fortran` and `CUDA C/Fortran` languages on Linux. Please take my Github repositories as reference.

## Test math formulas
$$
\mathbf{j} = -\nabla\cdot c
$$
