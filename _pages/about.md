## Brief introduction
I am a undergraduate student majoring bioinformatics and minoring mathematics at CUHK-Shenzhen who are expected to graduate in 2023.

## Seeking positions!
With a strong interest in the nature of physics and chemistry, I am seeking for a postgraduate degree about computational chemistry/biology currently.

## Skills
Although I hardly took any CS-related courses during undergraduate study, benefit from the ability of self-learning and willing to implement my thoughts, I am able to perform basic programming using `Python`, `Fortran` and `CUDA C/Fortran` languages on Linux. Please take my Github repositories as reference.

## Interest
* Computational chemistry methods and applications
* Statistical mechanics theory and related algorithms
* Statistical learning apply on computational chemistry/biology

## Hobby & life
